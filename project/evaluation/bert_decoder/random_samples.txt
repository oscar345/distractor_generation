Context: Very few of the transition metals are found in nature as free metals. Consequently, almost all metallic elements must be isolated from metal oxide or metal sulfide ores. Metallurgy is the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity. Many ores contain relatively low concentrations of the desired metal; for example, copper ores that contain even 1% Cu by mass are considered commercially useful. After an ore has been mined, the first step in processing is usually to crush it because the rate of chemical reactions increases dramatically with increased surface area. Next, one of three general strategies is used to separate and concentrate the compound(s) of interest: settling and flotation, which are based on differences in density between the desired compound and impurities; pyrometallurgy, which uses chemical reduction at high temperatures; and hydrometallurgy, which employs chemical or electrochemical reduction of an aqueous solution of the metal. Other methods that take advantage of unusual physical or chemical properties of a particular compound may also be used. For example, crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) are tiny but rather powerful magnets; in fact, magnetite (also known as lodestone) was used to make the first compasses in China during the first century BC. If a crushed ore that contains magnetite is passed through a powerful magnet, the Fe3O4 particles are attracted to the poles of the magnet, allowing them to be easily separated from other minerals.

Context: In reality, most animal behaviors are not controlled by nature or nurture. Instead, they are influenced by both nature and nurture. In dogs, for example, the tendency to behave toward other dogs in a certain way is probably controlled by genes. However, the normal behaviors canâ€™t develop in an environment that lacks other dogs. A puppy raised in isolation from other dogs may never develop the normal behaviors. It may always fear other dogs or act aggressively toward them.

Context: Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. For instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces). The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. In this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple harmonic motion.

Context: The number of molecular orbitals produced is the same as the number of atomic orbitals used to create them (the law of conservation of orbitals). As the overlap between two atomic orbitals increases, the difference in energy between the resulting bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals increases. When two atomic orbitals combine to form a pair of molecular orbitals, the bonding molecular orbital is stabilized about as much as the antibonding molecular orbital is destabilized. The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same energy.

Context: DNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer. Elongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues. RNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity. Gaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs. The gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds. Table 14.1 summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each.

Context: Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as shown in Figure below . Exocytosis occurs when a cell produces substances for export, such as a protein, or when the cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin. Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved on top the plasma membrane by exocytosis. For a detailed animation of cellular secretion, see http://vcell. ndsu. edu/animations/constitutivesecretion/first. htm .

Context: Fuel Cells A fuel cell is a galvanic cell that requires a constant external supply of reactants because the products of the reaction are continuously removed. Unlike a battery, it does not store chemical or electrical energy; a fuel cell allows electrical energy to be extracted directly from a chemical reaction. In principle, this should be a more efficient process than, for example, burning the fuel to drive an internal combustion engine that turns a generator, which is typically less than 40% efficient, and in fact, the efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40% and 60%. Unfortunately, significant cost and reliability problems have hindered the wide-scale adoption of fuel cells. In practice, their use has been restricted to applications in which mass may be a significant cost factor, such as US manned space vehicles. These space vehicles use a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell that requires a continuous input of H2(g) and O2(g), as illustrated in Figure 19.16 "A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Produces Electrical Energy Directly from a Chemical Reaction". The electrode reactions are as follows: Equation 19.93.

Context: Water pollution comes from many sources. One of the biggest sources is runoff. Runoff picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the chemicals to bodies of water. The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of algae, creating algal blooms (see Figure below ). The algae use up oxygen in the water so that other aquatic organisms cannot survive. This has occurred over large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones , where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico. Measures that can help prevent these problems include cutting down on fertilizer use. Preserving wetlands also helps because wetlands filter runoff water.
